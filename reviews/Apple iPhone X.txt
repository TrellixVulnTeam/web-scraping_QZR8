[{'body': 'Everyone reading this is probably familiar with the Apple phone line up so I am going to focus on the differences between the iPhone X and iPhone 7 plus specifically.First off, the set-up process has been significantly streamlined. When setting up your new iPhone X setup will ask you if your old iPhone is nearby, select yes, and you can wireless transfer all your apps, settings, backgrounds, passwords, etc. to your new phone in a few clicks. I really appreciated this streamlined process and it was incredibly quick and easy to transfer all my settings to my new iPhone X.The other main features that have been upgraded are as follows:New screen (5.8‚Äù OLED is the most vibrant and clear screen ever produced by Apple)- Apple has removed the touch ID sensor and bezel around the old iPhone screen which means the iPhone X has a noticeably smaller footprint while maintaining a larger screen size than the iPhone 7/8 Plus. (See comparison images attached of the iPhone X versus iPhone 7 Plus).- OLED Screen offers deeper blacks and brighter whites resulting in greater color reproduction.- Similar to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus the iPhone X uses true tone technology to mimic the lighting conditions around it and adjust the white balance accordingly.- The notch cut out of the top of the screen is where Apple has included the face recognition sensors, front camera, and a host of other sensors. I thought this would be annoying but Apple has cleverly used the screen real estate on both sides to include the time, date, battery indicators, etc.Farewell Touch-ID, Hello Face-ID- Face-ID is Apples new facial recognition technology which has replaced the finger printer reader and home button in order to free up additional screen real-estate. This is new and only available on the iPhone X.- Apples facial recognition is light years ahead of Samsung or any other carrier. I have tested this flawlessly with glasses, a hat, and even in the dark. It is as simple as looking at your phone and swiping up from the bottom.- I was worried this feature would be inconsistent or frustrating but it has worked really well. The only time it is a bit more inconvenient is if the phone is sitting on your desk or a flat surface you kind of have to lean over a bit or angle the phone towards you to unlock it.- This super powerful new camera also enables the animoji features which maps your facial expressions to create a talking emoji. This is a fun feature but more a novelty than anything.- This same true-depth camera makes the iPhone X the ultimate phone for taking selfies. The new portrait mode allows the user blur the background, or even cut yourself out entirely and place yourself on a black background.Additional noteworthy features and changes:- The rear camera boasts a dual 12MP sensor array with improved aperture and wide angle lens with image stabilization. The increased aperture from 2.8 to 2.4 allows for better images in low light conditions.- Video capabilities have also approved as well to include 60p 4k video recording delivering clear, fluid images.- Increased audio quality and volume- Increased RAM size to 3GB and new Bionic Chip makes the iPhone X one of the most powerful smartphones are the market.- Updated design features glass back and sides which make the phone beautiful looking. A very welcome change in the normal design.- Battery life: The iPhone X boasts the largest battery in Apple history with a 2716 mAh battery which is a bit larger than the new iPhone 8 Plus. A full charge from 0-100% takes about 2 hours and 10 minutes in my testing.- In addition, wireless charging has finally been added to the new iPhone X, and 8 series phones. I have not tested this out but am excited to give it a try (Wireless charging pad is not included with the phone).Bottom line, the iPhone X is another smash hit from Apple. Every feature people were concerned about turned out to work flawlessly as usual. I have only had the iPhone for about 24 hours so it is early to leave a long-term focused review but so far the new iPhone X has lived up to the hype. The iPhone X may not revolutionize the smart phone industry but it is a welcome upgrade to the iPhone which designs were getting a bit dated. I am excited about Apples new strategy to release a flagship model and allow the new features to trickle down to next generation‚Äôs phones.If you have the money to spare you won‚Äôt likely be disappointed. My only complaint is the phone only comes in 64GB or 256GB basically forcing users to pay an extra $150 to get decent storage. Further, the beautiful glass back on the screen feels fantastic and has a great weight to it. However, a replacement screen will cost you $275+ and the back glass replacement is rumored to cost around $400. Essentially a single drop could result in a $700 repair bill. Unfortunately this means most phones will be shielded in a case and will not be enjoyed.Read less***Note Carrier Compatibility:All carrier variant iPhone X in the world are carrier unlocked.

Not sure why people would over pay. My brothers and I began buying and upgraded to the latest iPhone since the very first version and the iPhone X is one the the biggest changes that I can remember. Much like going from the iPhone 3GS to the 4 was or the iPhone 5 to the 6.The X model looses the Home Button and doesn‚Äôt have a the headphone jack like the 7‚Äôs. No big deal on the headphone jack. Sometimes I do prefer plugging a set in and not having to worry about Bluetooth.The lack of a Home button does take some time getting use too. It is really different with the swipe gestures but after a day or so you get use to it. Basically learning a new way to switch and X out of apps. I like it now after using it.The phone is fast, feels crisper than the 7. Safari is snappier and pretty much all the apps are.The phones size is somewhat like the 7, feels thinner but is a tad larger.If you can afford it, you will be happy. I played with the iPhone 8 and it feels quicker too.The Face ID works really well. Being brothers that look a lot alike we try to trick it but it doesn‚Äôt work. This is the first of what will be new technologies for Apple like the Face ID, this was probably rushed and the next version will be more secure and work better. But it seems to work fine right now and does take the place of the finger ID pretty well.Camera takes awesome pictures.The 256g model can hold a lot of data which is nice and since your spending a grand you might as well spend the extra money and get the extra memoryPleased so far and looks like a solid reliable phone. In all fairness though, I could get by just fine with the iPhone 7 that I have been using. The main thing I like is the larger screen which is gorgeous and the faster processor. I love the phone but honestly I could have waited a year for the next model. If you can afford it now you‚Äôll enjoy it. The size is perfect for me and the screen is awesome.Get a good case to protect it with which also hide the gorgeous design. I never really saw the iPhone 7 in black that I had because I always had it in a heavy duty case to protect it.

If you would like a list of just my thoughts on the phone, scroll down to the bullet point list.The transition:NO home button! The staple of the iPhone is gone; well, moved to a little notch at the top. I was expecting this transition to  a home-button-less iPhone to be difficult, but all of the gestures feel so natural. I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky. Switching through apps, opening the phone, accessing everything, it's all so easy. Now, this isn't to say there isn't a transition and while everything feels natural, there is a period of time where you have to get used to the new interface and some aspects that initially seemed difficult become second nature. For example, reachability was a favorite feature of mine and while it was initially hard to activate, I have now learned how to activate it without an issue (reachability brings the iPhone screen down halfway to reach top parts of the screen without moving your hand).Face ID:I was skeptical to say the least, but Face ID works (almost) perfect. It does however learn from its missteps and if it fails to identify you, it will add that data to its cache. I personally scanned my face normally the first time and on the second scan did it at roughly a 45 degree angle so I could lean over my phone to view notifications. As I've adjusted to Face ID, it has gotten faster and faster at scanning my face and it's not something you need to wait on to open your phone. By the time you swipe up on your phone, it's unlocked and ready to go (I seriously forget I have a password). I also really enjoy the ability to utilize Face ID for my password for other logins and the ability to open up an app directly from the lock screen without having to then enter my fingerprint/passcode.It's important to note here that your privacy is well, yours. No one has access to the data Face ID gather's and it is truly yours. Apple has a good track record on keeping your data private as they are not in the data business (hello Google & Facebook).The price:There seems to be this running idea that a $1,000 phone is a crazy purchase, but I would have to disagree. Why? My logic is as followed: Phone's are one of the most used devices (easily mine) so for starters, I would like a nice one. If I didn't buy the device in full, I would have been paying roughly $2/ a day on a contract with Verizon. The base model is a 64GB iPhone loaded with the best Apple has to offer. A 128GB 6S at launch was $850. Yes, there's a price difference, but my point is that it's not as gigantic as it may seem. I personally would advocate a 64GB version and utilizing cloud storage if you need more space, but do note, this is Apple's flagship and there are cheaper iPhone's out there.What I love:- The screen looks amazing. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep with black wallpapers flowing aimlessly into the phone (to the point you cannot see the notch in the screen if the wallpaper is black).- The Notch! Yes, the notch. Some people seem to hate it, I think it's iconic and makes the iPhone X stand alone in oled sphere. It fades into the user experience and I have not had any issues with it.- The screen size. I have always wanted a plus, but I always felt like it was too big for my hands. That I would drop the phone and there it goes. The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 6S. The screen truly looks amazing and if you haven't seen one, check one out at a local store.- I'm not sure how much of this is just because my 6S was a few years old, but the taptic engine in the X is amazing. As in, when the phone vibrates, I can easily identify what it is through the vibration and the vibration itself feels smooth.- Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way.- The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera.- The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for impromptu music listening.- The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it.What I don't:Honestly, I do not have a genuine complaint at this point. The only complaint that comes to mind revolves around the lack of optimization I have faced in some apps, but that is a developer problem and even then, developers have optimized a majority of their apps and my issues have been few and far between.", 'title': 'From a 6S to an X - A wonderful, luxury, phone', 'star_rating': '5', 'author': 'Taylor', 'date': 'November 9, 2017', 'votes': '13'}][{'body': "iPhone X came brand new and sealed.

The back of it glows - it‚Äôs beautiful to behold and wonderful to Handle and use - couple it with the Spigen Clear case - don‚Äôt hide the elegance and beauty - and those cases protect well using advanced materials for under ¬£8. (In 5 years I‚Äôve never damaged a phone when using the Spigen Clear).The screen is bigger than that of an iPhone Plus - but the handset is regular iPhone (6,7,8) sized - a tad bigger but hardly noticeable in the hand - and yes, unlike the iPhone Plus you can use this more or less one handed.The build quality is impeccable - it really is a premium device - the touch and feel - materials used - the screen pops at you (the ‚Äònotch‚Äô has the cameras and is a design feature which reminds me of the bite taken out of the Apple - it differentiates your device from a common or garden Android cross breed) and the speakers are evidently louder and fuller with more range of sound and resonance than normal mobile phone speakers - so you can actually listen to music on it.(I wonder how the built in sound DSP DAC compares and fares in tests?)Battery life is the best I‚Äôve seen on a smartphone - a whole day of heavy use and by midnight I still had 40%.Reception and call quality again is as good as you can get.The hardware is gorgeous and coupled with the advanced internals you the have best handset on the market.But gorgeous hardware isn‚Äôt what makes a phone great - that‚Äôs the OS - and a modern OS should be user friendly, intuitive, beautiful to look at and a joy to use - it should also be fast and stable - so no annoying crashes or screen lock ups - this flies through every test and is a pleasure to use.Firstly Face ID - works more efficiently and more responsive than the finger sensor - works even in the dark and early morning with curtains shut and face screwed up - also effortlessly works with the browser, App Store purchases and other apps - and most apps have been updated to use this plus the gestures and screen of this iPhone X.The OS is a killer - the removal of the home button is a massive plus feature which turns a clunky device into magic - leaving any half baked Android offering eating dust.iOS 11 on the iPhone X is WebOS 2017 - to think that Palm was so far ahead of its time - it built the most elegant and intuitive mobile phone OS back in the noughties - it‚Äôs give or take what the experience on the iPhone X is today.The iPhone X is beautiful to use intuitive gesture based card system more of less as was WebOS - switching apps? Swipe across the bottom - closing apps? Gently touch and Swipe a card up - switch apps? Swipe up and select the cards - and it multitasks properly - the camera and YouTube will run in card form (as on the WebOS TouchPad and Pre 3) - using every part of the screen to good effect - swipe from top right - from top or bottom reveals other features - and all fast responsive and with not a single crash or screen lock up in sight.I always hated the home button - coming from WebOS and HP Touchpad the iOS of the day was clunky and unintuitive - I noticed over the years how the iOS versions slowly morphed into what WebOS was - the morphing is complete with the dropping of the Hone Button and an adoption of an elegant intuitive card gesture based system which is a pleasure to use - the iPhone X is the best handset in the market and with the new iOS version it‚Äôs clearly the most beautiful intuitive elegant and user friendly - most stable and effortless OS on the market.A winner - thank you Apple and thank you Palm WebOS.', 'title': 'WebOS reborn - the most beautiful, elegant, intuitive, user friendly, stable OS on the best hardware', 'star_rating': '5', 'author': "Ibraar 'Le Saracen'", 'date': 'November 16, 2017', 'votes': '9'}, {'body': 'I think people need to comprehend if they are reviewing the price OR THE PEFORMANCE OF THE PHONE.

So I would it‚Äôs good battery life but it could be better if apple give us a bigger battery. Light user will get through a full day with no problem.Screen : What can I say this screen is the best one to touch an iPhone yet! I lover the way everything just pops at you with this display . It‚Äôs on par with the Note 8 screen if not better from my personal believe. This screen is longer then the one on the 7 plus but it is not as wide as that screen and I like that but many people do not! It feels better in my hand with the more narrow screen.Speakers: They are very loud compared to my iPhone 7 Plus big upgrade. I keep them around 70% volume. It‚Äôs very clear and crisp ! They ear speaker at the top is about loud as the bottom fire speaker now  ! That‚Äôs no exaggeration  neither.No Touch ID: I forget about it completely but I did see myself reaching for it the first two days of use.Face ID: I‚Äôm loving it so far! It was a learning curve though you can‚Äôt put it to close or to far away from your face. I found the elbow length away from your face is the perfect position. It does work in complete darkness I tested this while and a closet a night time lol.Cameras: if you had the iPhone 7 like me the iPhone X cameras are a slight improvement with quality, The stabilization is what has improved greatly ! Everybody that has shakey hands recording I‚Äôm glad to say the iPhone X is your cure. Portrait mode is great when it works ! You have to have perfectly lighting and also have to be close to the phone for it to work I hate that .

It took nearly 6 weeks to receive. It is significantly small than the iPhone 6 plus by size. The actual screen dimensions is about the same. Yes, the color is somewhat brighter but the clarity and brightness is not (even with adjustments). Simple to set up and outside of no home button (swipe up), it is essentially the same layout. I would agree with other reviewers, it is no faster than the older model. The camera does produce a nicer photo but is this device worth $1300 for a better camera? I do not think so. You could purchase an even nicer camera for less. Facial recognition is fair to good but far from perfect. I ended up switching to digital security since I use the phone for work. I need as close to absolute security as possible. Speaker sound is better in volume and clarity. As you go from screen to screen (different applications), you can literally feel the phone shake like one use to feel hard drives activate in older laptops. I do not know what is up with this since in all my previous iPhones I never felt any mechanical movement from the phone itself. Everything works appropriately but this brief vibration is more annoying to me than the absence of the home button and being able to turn the phone off my pressing one button instead of two. Bad workmanship to engineering. Bottom line: if you do not absolutely have to upgrade your phone or you are not receiving the phone free (AT&T is giving a free iPhone 8 with an added line), then I would wait for the next generation. A larger phone is anticipated with the "X" features but I must admit I find the "X" is under-featured when it comes to being a pivotal new generation of iPhones. The iPhone X is anything but pivotal, ground breaking (outside of dropping it, it will indeed break) or full of new useful features you do not already have on your current iPhone. Even if I had to upgrade I would go with the iPhone 8 plus over the "X" since you keep the home button and larger size is nice for jacket pocket and those with bigger hands. To say I am disappointed in the iPhone X is an understatement. I have monitors which are more impressive than this phone\'s screen and cost a third of this phone. In my world, I have already abandoned the Apple laptops and iMacs for my workplace and home for similar unimpressive advancements in technology. I am now going to do the same with my phones as well. Will try Samsung and other models for the future. Apple is loosing their magic touch since the loss of Steve Jobs. Some individuals do indeed make a company great. I have little doubt Jobs would have been very unhappy with this iPhone and would never have released it but made the company wait 6-12 months to have something truly better than the status quo.

The camera on the iPhone X is really cool, but for the type of photos I like to take, the Pixel 2 XL's camera wins.If I still had my iPhone 8, I would definitely prefer it over the iPhone X.I think Apple went a little too high on the cost at first and didn't properly delegate their time on the other aspects of the device that were also important.I know Apple will quickly fix the bugs and weird quirks the iPhone X has now, but it would've been nice to feel like the money was well spent when I received it.I'll update my review in a month.", 'title': 'Liked My iPhone 8 Better...', 'star_rating': '2', 'author': 'Tank Shake', 'date': 'November 16, 2017', 'votes': '11'}, {'body': 'Savage', 'title': 'Five Stars', 'star_rating': '5', 'author': 'Nicole Wilson', 'date': 'December 19, 2017', 'votes': None}, {'body': 'Excellent phone very pleased with it', 'title': 'Apple has done a great work with there product', 'star_rating': '5', 'author': 'Don Gavey', 'date': 'December 30, 2017', 'votes': None}, {'body': 'Very good', 'title': 'Five Stars', 'star_rating': '5', 'author': 'jeimy sanchez', 'date': 'December 9, 2017', 'votes': None}, {'body': 'Awesome', 'title': 'Five Stars', 'star_rating': '5', 'author': 'Dawn', 'date': 'December 7, 2017', 'votes': None}, {'body': 'This is the worst iPhone I‚Äôve had the miss fortune of having.

The dimensions of the device are such that it is wide and quite noticeably cuts into the hand. The back panel is made of tempered glass, as well as the front panel covering the screen with oleophobic coating, but the marks from the hands are clearly visible. The glass panel behind is needed for wireless charging. On the left side there is a lever, which includes a noiseless mode, below - two volume keys. On the right side, the on / off button (in fact, it\'s now unlocking and calling Siri), just below - the tray for the nanoSIM card. At the bottom of the right is the speaker, the second speaker is on the front panel above the screen. They work in pairs, and the volume of the sound is different, for this parameter iPhone X can give odds to many flagships, and I like it in this aspect. The microphone is on the bottom end, and also at the camera block behind. At the top end, the microphone was not placed. The noise reduction system works medium, in noisy conditions your interlocutor hears strange sounds. Places for the percentage of battery power on the display just do not.In iPhone X, the battery charge is very quickly consumed during voice calls, which is not typical for such devices.Unlike a fingerprint, you can register only one person. No way to share the phone with biometrics, only a password that can be passed on to someone.In practice, face recognition is quickly adjusted.When driving the iPhone X, the phone holder will have to be strongly shifted to the left to the handlebar, and also tilt it towards the face, otherwise no recognition occurs.I really like how the device records video (especially 4K at a rate of 60 frames per second), but this video can only be viewed on the device itself, since a new compression format is used, when transmitting all video is converted. In the maximum resolution mode, the sound is written to one microphone.In iPhone X changed the interface and it will take a little time to get used to the lack of the "Home" key.', 'title': 'First impressions after a week of use', 'star_rating': '4', 'author': 'Armen', 'date': 'November 26, 2017', 'votes': None}, {'body': 'It‚Äôs slower to start up and the facial recognition only works part of the time.
