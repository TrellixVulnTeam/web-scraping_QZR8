[{'body': 'I purchased an iPhone 8 64 GB from Ting after using an iPhone 5C for two years. I‚Äôm finding it super-fast and enjoyable to use. The screen is bright when it needs to be and dims well in the dark. It‚Äôs beautifully manufactured and Has a great camera that‚Äôs enhanced by really solid image processing built into iOS. Without doubt, the phone more expensive than it reasonably should be, but keep in mind that when you buy a high-end phone like this, you‚Äôre paying for more than the phone itself. You‚Äôre paying your part of the cost of running a global enterprise that vets the software available in the App Store for safety, provides a global secure text and voice messaging infrastructure, and invests constantly in developing the phone you‚Äôll buy two to four years from today. Android phones are an awesome alternative, especially the mid-level phones that provide incredible hardware and software flexibility, often for as little as $250. But they‚Äôre not as joyful to use or as tightly tied to the Apple ecosystem. It‚Äôs a tough choice to make, but the good news is, it‚Äôs hard to go wrong. As someone who uses my phone all day long for a hundred different things, buying this phone was an easy call. If you just want a great smartphone and don‚Äôt care about the whole Apple universe much, then maybe look elsewhere.', 'title': 'Fast and capable, but more than a smartphone alone', 'star_rating': '5', 'author': 'M.
