[{'body': 'I bought this for its durable build. I plan to keep it for a long while, so I wanted the gorilla glass 5. And I really like the length of the screen that the Pixel 2 XL version has in comparison to the Pixel 2. The phone works well in every way. I did have difficulty activating initially, but I can\'t blame the phone. The phone is an LTE phone, so it supports both GSM and CDMA networks. And ALL Pixel 2 phones are unlocked. But it came in a box that had "CDMA" printed in large letters, which confused me. And it had a Verizon SIM card already in its SIM slot. I thought that I could just bring it to a Sprint store and let them activate this phone. The phone number that I wished to use was already with Sprint (CDMA). But that was a complete fiasco that lasted three hours. At that point, I came very close to returning the phone. But I picked up a Consumer Cellular SIM card (GSM) from Target. Over the phone, Consumer Cellular ported the phone number from Sprint in a matter of seconds, activated the SIM card, and helped me manually enter the special strings needed to enable Internet over their data connection. So far, it\'s been perfect ever since.Read more', 'title': 'And I really like the length of the screen that the Pixel 2 ...', 'star_rating': '5', 'author': None, 'date': 'uary 6, 2018', 'votes': None}, {'body': 'Great phone from Google.

Finally, the screen blue shift isn't even noticeable after using the phone for a few days and the screen colours aren't overly saturated. You will notice the lack of saturation when switching to this phone from any other but after a few days you will see other phone screens as oddly coloured.

Here\'s what bothers me about the phone:  1) cannot shoot 4k video at 60fps; 2) iPhone display looks better especially on video playback; 3) can\'t turn off the Google Assistant voice, so it always speaks an answer out loud when I would prefer it stay silent and merely display an answer (annoying out in public when you ask Google Assistant "what\'s the forecast" and it starts blathering for 20 seconds); 4) Google Assistant often gives incorrect answers to questions, or occasionally simply freezes when asked a question;  5) you can send a text message via Google Assistant by saying "send a text message to Bill Smith" ... but it won\'t reliably send an email; 6) Google Pixel tech support is  easy to contact and friendly, but their Philippines-based employees are far from expert; 7) the speakers heavily distort sound at high volume, so as a practical matter you\'re limited to using 2/3 volume; 8) the battery charges slowly.Read more', 'title': 'Not Ready for Primetime', 'star_rating': '3', 'author': None, 'date': 'ember 28, 2017', 'votes': '47'}, {'body': 'In simple words, the Pixel is the Android iPhone.The hardware quality matches the iPhone.

The glass is curved and there are no decent screen protectors for it. Scrolling content causes it to smear across the screen, making it illegible - you have to completely stop scrolling to read anything clearly. No headphone jack. The squeeze gimmick is useless. Buttons fall off - how does that impact water resistance?! Incredibly slow fast-charging, it takes 2x as long as my last phone to charge.It does have excellent battery life...
