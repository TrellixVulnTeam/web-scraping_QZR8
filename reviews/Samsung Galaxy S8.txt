[{'body': 'BEWARE!99% of the negative reviews are SELLER REVIEWS! People bought used products or from a private seller and got something not covered by amazon. BUY NEW, FROM AMAZON. If you don\'t know how to shop, I suggest you double check where the item is coming from in your cart and before you check out. PAY ATTENTION!After owning the phone long enough to be familiar with it, I thought I would leave a decent review outlining some of the pro\'s and con\'s, as well as some neutral\'s. My review is as follows: (see end comments about unlocked and verizon use - this phone is 100% unlocked!)Pro\'s:1. Very sleek design. Very nice screen and overall a great phone.2. The camera/video recorder is AMAZING. Simple as that. I took amazing outdoor and indoor (even in low light/no light) pictures. I am genuinely impressed and was not expecting it to be so good. (See last pic. Photo on phone was taken by s8)3. The pixel ratio/screen size. I got the s8 because I did not want a huge computer in my pocket, and it has plenty of room in it.4. Very fast. The processor even with battery settings set to a mid level (which can be changed to your personal preference) is still fast enough to do anything you can throw at it.5. RAM and Storage ration. Perfect. Plenty of ram to handle multi-tasking and plenty of storage to handle those 4k videos/pictures PLUS room to expand with SD storage, which is also getting much better and bigger. But 64GB entry level... eat your heart out apple.6. Great speaker! I mean wow... this thing get\'s loud. I was also not expecting such great sound. You will have no trouble hearing anything even in a loud environment. Seriously amazed here.7. Power saving/Battery life. Simply put, the AMOLED allows for some amazing battery life and the 3000mah batter holds up well. Very well. Much better than the iPhone.8. Fast charging. The lowest I have had the battery is about 60% and it charged in under an hour.9. AMOLED screen. As stated in #7, it helps with battery life but other than that, it has plenty of brightness and picture clarity. I also carified in #3 that the screen size and pixel ratio were simply stunning. You will notice this if you game alot or during those 4k picture zooms and probably much more on the s8+.10. Accessories and headphone jack. It has a headphone jack! lol. The accessories that came with the phone are great. A fast charging cable, a type-c to mini usb extension, and a usb to type-c extension as well. The headphones are simply amazing too. By far some of the best I have owned, as far as ear buds go, and you don\'t have to pay for good quality here. The material of them is great and they come with extra different size earbuds.11. Water resistance. While I have not tested it, and probably never will, it\'s a great feature. I still don\'t recommend dunking your phone.12. Pocket settings. There is an option to keep the screen off while in your pocket, or something like a purse. Simple as that. If you butt dial, you probably are not navigating the settings well enough. Keep in mind, android has A LOT of settings, and it would be wise to go through them all including the basic options that samsung offers.13. Widget size. You can actually adjust the size of every single widget, and fit more apps on the pages as well as the default home row. You can also change the lock screen apps, if you want any at all. I personally have a camera and the phone app on the lock screen, and keep all my apps on a single page, in folders, the weather, a google search bar with the mic button, and lastly a control panel for quick access to bluetooth and auto-sync buttons etc etc.. All on one page, with plenty of empty space. Half the screen is even still empty. Thank you so much for resizeable widgets.Neutral:1. Bixby button. The button is below the volume buttons, so nothing you can do there. However, you can disable bixby. Most reviews on here are failing to realize this and also failing to outline how. See the end of my review for simple instructions.2. Phone Length. I\'ll admit, it\'s pretty long. Maybe I am just to used to an older, smaller phone, but one handed operations is going to take some getting used to. Be mindful of the edges of the screen too. Too much palm and you will be scrolling. I do not see this as a negative still, just takes some getting used to and as outlined in the pro\'s section, the overall screen size is perfect.3. Edge lighting. A bit torn on this one. It seems cool, but is pretty much useless. It\'s basically a notification before the notification. So you would have to tap twice and then unlock as well. IMHO, it does look really cool, but SAMSUNG needs to give us more control over it.4. Always on display. This can also be turned off. I find it 100% useless, but not a negative by any means. I feel it can definitely cater to some users who enjoy always being able to look at their phone. I personally disabled it and honestly looked no further into it.5. Color settings. I have always disliked samsung\'s default colors. Especially on TV\'s. However, there is an option to change them to your liking. I chose the basic setting, but there is even an option to change balance which let\'s you arrange a set of liked color boxes, whites, and blacks to your liking and all kinds of other options for personal preference. It really is a great setting, however, it is a neutral and not a pro simply because they enable a very rich color by default. So I recommend changing this to suite your own eyeballs.6. The lock screen clock/theme settings. In order to change the lock screen clock, you have to register with samsung themes and install a theme, which can be somewhat custom. I did this, and the deactivated my account. The setting were retained and all is well. Still a neutral because I feel samsung should incorporate a way to change the lock screen clock by default to a couple preset clocks. The standard one IMHO, is ugly and not aesthetically pleasing to read.Con\'s:1. Typical android settings. Everything is always on. This is not a samsung issue, but android. I recommend going through every single option, and every single app to change every single setting. Sometimes, this can take the first week of owning an android phone to get right. This also almost always has a HUGE impact on battery life. There are settings in sub-menu\'s of settings. So please, NAVIGATE YOUR ANDROID SETTINGS! Your poor battery life is not due to this phone at all. It is due to negligence and laziness.2. "Ok Google". This seems to always be on, even when turned off in googles settings. I have a search bar and I have turned off all settings both in the phone and google, but for some reason if you say those two naughty words, it still comes up. However, if you do not set it up, it will only be asking you to set it up. Same thing as bixby almost, but this is a negative because I do not want my mic on. At all. I think samsung needs to address this before anything else, even the bixby issues some people are not liking or failing to change.3. All glass. The phone is not strong by any means. It does not feel like a cheap POS, but it is all glass. This belongs in the negative because most of us are drop prone, and even if you are not, it is very easy to make a mistake. Overall, it looks amazing, but there is no need for a glass backing too. I highly recommend you get a case, and if you are in fact drop prone, get a big durable case like an otterbox with a screen protector. The risk will always be there with all smart phones, but the s8 being all glass just seems pointless. That said, I have NEVER dropped a phone to a point where it broke (fingers crossed, knock on wood).4. The finger print scanner. What a stupid placement for a finger print scanner. Right next to the camera lense? come on... I personally do not use it at all, but if I did and wanted to take a picture, you would be cleaning your lense as soon as you unlocked it. Nobody wants to take an unclear photo because they used the finger print security feature. I like the Google Plus one, but feel that if any, Apple has the best one being in the home button.On a side note: THIS PHONE IS UNLOCKED. It can be used with ANY carrier. If you do not pay attention to who or where you buy it from, at least leave a sellers review instead of a product review. 99% of the negative reviews are this. Please pay attention and buy a new phone from Amazon only. I do not ever recommend getting a refurb on this kind of product, or buying from a private seller regardless of their rating. You just never know.As for Bixby, all you have to do is not set it up and hold the home screen like you are adding a widget, scroll to the left and hit the button to turn it off. This will not remove it, but will stop it from doind whatever crazy stuff these other reviews are talking about. I have had NO ISSUES with bixby, because I turned it off. Also, make sure you go through your settings, including the subsettings imbedded into android like background data usage etc etc and turn it all off. People having battery issues, I guarantee it is not the s8\'s fault. It is android and you would not get any better life with iOS for failing to go through your settings. GO THROUGH YOUR SETTINGS! every. single. one. Over and over for a week until you find every nook and cranny. There is a lot!Overall, this phone is amazing. The list of pro\'s, con\'s, and neutral\'s are simply my take and my opinion. I do recommend the phone. At least if you are in a position to think about it and can try it, go to a local store and pick one up on the display to play with it, but it\'s just not the same as owning it. I was torn between a google pixel xl and this one, but when this dropped in price it made my decision that much easier. I did like the idea of a bigger phone, however, I just kept thinking how big it would be in my pocket. So I went with the standard s8 and I am very happy I did. I do a lot of fishing, hiking, and outdoor stuff and 90% of the time, I TRY to keep my phone around me in my pocket in case of an emergency. Usually off, because where I go there is no signal anyways.Any review stating a mostly negative opinion, in my opinion, is probably a bit trollish or did not do any research and made an impulse buy. I think you can get used to this phone and if you are complaining about the things I have outlined here, the only one to blame is you. So give it a try, navigate ALL the settings, get used to android, and don\'t drop this phone lol!

Man it's beautiful. Sleek design and powerful hardware. I did a comparison with my old phone and you certainly can feel that it's more powerful. I'm not used to it yet. But it does everything perfectly. The picture quality is superb. I love shooting video and it nails it in video quality and it does slow motion!! say whaaaat!! But sometimes it overheats under the direct sun when I record video but I think that is normal. I don't use the fingerprint sensor only because I can't find it. And the mono speaker under the phone is a downside which most of the time I cover it with my little finger and it's kinda annoying. Other than that it's freaking fast and top notch phone.

Easily the most stunning display ever on a phone, great specs, Samsung Pay, expandable storage, and waterproofing SHOULD make this the best phone on the market. Enter Samsung's software. While Touchwiz isn't nearly the raging dumpster fire it was back in the S4 and S5 days, there's still a lot of extras that most will consider junk. Chief among these is Bixby. Have you ever wondered what Siri would be like if it were dumber and had a dedicated hardware button? That's Bixby. Not content to let Google do the heavy lifting, Samsung's MO continues to be creating inferior versions of services already offered by Big G. Want to remap that button to something actually useful? Too bad. Samsung keeps patching the phone in order to force their bloatware down your throat. As it is, that's a dead button that you'll press once out of curiosity, and a few dozen times while trying to turn down the volume. One other annoyance of note is the horrible placement of the fingerprint scanner. There's just no excuse for this one.Overall, it's a great phone that's held back by Samsung's usual goofball decisions.", 'title': 'Gorgeous hardware, same old Sammy.', 'star_rating': '3', 'author': 'Honest Opinion', 'date': 'August 1, 2017', 'votes': '164', 'verified_purchase': True}, {'body': 'I haven\'t owned a Galaxy phone since the Galaxy Nexus.I\'ve always felt that Samsung\'s Touch Wiz UI was too gimmicky and looked cartoon-ish.This is my 5th phone in the last 6 months. I was coming from a Nexus 6P, One Plus 3T, Axon 7 and LG V20.I really liked the LG V20 for it\'s cameras and the Axon 7 for it\'s front facing speakers. The 6P and One Plus 3Twere so smooth. But I decided to trade it all in for the S8.I was initially going to get a Google Pixel, but prices were still high and besides the camera, not much appealed to me.The S8 is a damn sexy phone with over 80% of the front being the screen. I like the size. Fits perfectly in my hands.I don\'t think I will go back to a 6" phablet phone. The screen is vibrant. The clear flip cover case works well with it too.Touch Wiz has been toned down from what I remember, but there is still a lot of bloatware, which I quickly disabled.I guess I like all the screen shot options this phone has to offer. You take screen shot many ways, annotate, make gifs, etc.Charging is pretty fast and the battery lasts me all day. The included headphones are really good. Can\'t go wrong with AKG. They look cheap, but they sound superb. I\'m using Face Unlock, it\'s really fast. I have my finger print set up too, but face unlock is faster and more convenient. I guess someone can always hold up a picture right? (Haven\'t tried it yet) The finger print sensor takes a little bit to get used to. My finger naturally goes to the where the camera is located and you need to fully press on the sensor to get it to unlock.They should move the camera to the corner like some phones.USB-C is awesome.Bluethooth 5 is Awesome. You can now stream to 2 separate bluetooth speakers at the same time (one will have a slight delay though).I have a few gripes.Even though it has a F1.7 aperture the camera is not wide angle. It does take really good pictures and videos.My other gripe is the single speaker. C\'mon... it\'s 2017.... all Flagship phones should have stereo speakers.Get rid of Bixby. Let us just use Google Assist.By default the phone display is set to 2220X1080, which is fine for me. You can always set it to WQHD (2960X1440). I\'m not sure how much more battery the phone will be using if you did. I still like that Samsung lets you put a SD card it it and it comes with a OTG adapter so you can plug in other USB sticks too. The Edge panel is just ok. Still getting used to it. I can live without it.This phone has tons of other features too, but I\'m not going to list them all.

Specifically, the unlock screen can preview your message as a notification. However, anyone can see this if they look at your lock screen and there is only a notification on or off feature and no way I know to leave the notification on without a preview being displayed. The other issue I have is that there is no quick toggle button for GPS. You have to go into settings and flick it on and off there.

Then when my colleges told me about the issue, I started taking selfies, I notice that all the selfies have the same black spot in the same place. Unfortunately, I figured out the issue 36 days after I bout this phone from Amazon. So, I  could not return the phone due to the 30 days return policy.I contacted Samsung, they asked me to update and reset the phone and so a bunch of staff to the camera app. After the 2nd call, They sent me to a Repair Center close to my home. The repair center wanted to charge me $109 dollars. I called Samsung again. This time Samsung told me that because I was under warranty they can fix it for me. They cannot replace phones but just fix them. Samsung told me that they will take 11 days to fix it. I expressed my concern that I bought an expensive phone because the service as my work and my business depend on a reliable phone. I told them that I cannot afford 11 days without communication. So, they told me "Well you won\'t be without communication you can buy a ship phone and exchange the sim card until your phone cames back".So, does not Samsung understand that an unlock cheap phone cost at minimum 120 and it won\'t be able to multitask as fast I need to do my job and maintain my business?I do not recommend to buy this phone or any Samsung phone if service and reliability is the most important subject for your purchase.', 'title': 'Really bad service from Samsung.

My whole family and I have had Samsung Galaxies since the S3.  But this S8 annoys me to no end.  They are turning the Galaxy into an iPhone.  If I wanted form over function, silly proprietary annoyances just for the sake of an advertising image -- well, I would have bought an iPhone.  But I didn\'t.Battery:  I have had this S8 for 9 weeks now.  I cannot make it through the day without the phone dying.  That\'s bad enough.  But far, far worse is the fact that the battery cannot be changed. Lack of interchangeable batteries has long been the Achilles heel of iPhones.  iPhone users constantly complain about it.  So what does Samsung do?  Make a new model with a sealed, non-changeable battery.  So I guess we\'re supposed to just throw our $750 phone away once the battery goes bad. If all the other Galaxies has interchangeable batteries, and all us users loved it, why would you even consider removing that much-loved feature?  And don\'t tell me for waterproofing.  I don\'t care.  You should be able to figure that out.All-Glass Case:  Are you kidding me?  If you look at the phone wrong, it will break.  And it\'s unbelievably slippery.  Nice combination -- slippery, made of breakable glass, front and back.  People are breaking their phones between the time they get it at the T-Mobile store and the time Amazon Prime can deliver a protective case. And even with a case, it\'ll break. I mean come on, the whole thing is made of glass.  Of course it\'s going to break.Proprietary charging port:  The Galaxy S5 had a USB 3.0.  That was genius, seriously.  The S5 was universally compatible -- including backwards compatible with USB 2.0, which means practically every charging cable in the world could be used to charge it.  In addition, USB 3.0 is super fast for data transfers.  So, what does Samsung do?  Create a new, proprietary cable connection that doesn\'t exist anywhere else on any piece of technology ever invented.  What a great idea -- let\'s turn the best charging system into the worst.  And that\'s even worse than Apple.  iPhones are known for their unusable proprietary features, but at least there are lots of different iPhones that use their proprietary cable.  In this case, only the S8 uses this useless connection.Infinity Display:  Samsung touts the "uninterrupted surface that flows seamlessly over the edges".  Okay, one question.  Did anyone actually hold this phone in their hand before bringing it to market?  Because if they had, they would know that your hand cannot hold the phone without touching the "seamless edges." Obviously.  So, various parts of your hand are constantly interfering with the function of the phone. So, just holding the phone, my hand is constantly fighting with my fingers for control of the phone.  I\'d like to know -- who was asking for their phone to be turned into an infinity pool?  In case someone from Samsung is reading this, let me answer the rhetorical question: NO ONE.  No one cares that their phone wraps around the edge if it interferes with the operation of the phone.In other words -- form over function.  Give me a phone that works well over some gimmicky new change that no one cares about anyway.

As expected, the S8 was fast and slick, although some of the standard apps suffer from usability changes for the worse, compared to the S5.  I have come to expect this with any major software/hardware upgrade so it\'s hardly worth mentioning.Of note however, is the hoops I had to jump through to get this phone working with Verizon.  This review has less to do with any issues with the phone itself (there have been almost none) and more to do with the general incompetence of the specific staff at my local Verizon store.This unlocked 64GB phone is perfectly compatible with the Verizon network and now is working great; however, the Verizon store employees were unable to get my phone working out of the box because it was not a "Verizon Branded" S8.  Do yourself a favor; call Verizon tech support to get it figured out.  After almost a full day of fruitlessly working with the store employees and managers and being sent on one wild goose chase after another, a 15 minute call to Verizon tech support resolved everything.Note that this phone takes a mini SIM card and can\'t simply be swapped from the S5; this is why I had to endure a trip to the local Verizon store at all.Also note; if activating this unlocked phone on Verizon, they will not allow you to download or install their standard Verizon voicemail app.  You will be required to download another voicemail app/service from the Google app store.

This thing actually lasts me over 10 hours of almost constant Netflix streaming with brightness at 75% with bluetooth wireless earbuds and that only bring its to about 30-35% battery. It then still lasts the rest of the day at 25% brightness taking it down to just about 15% battery. (I normally start charging it up once it hits 20% though)-Camera Function: Incredibly fast focus and quality. (Only minor con is that it's not amazing in low light, using ProMode helps a bit though)-Smooth touchscreen with a lot of customization features within the phone itself.-Being an unlocked phone, minimal bloatware comes on the phone. (Sadly there are some things...)-You can easily turn Bixby off if you don't like it. (The camera item search/translator is pretty fun though!)-Always on display is actually really helpful for me since I don't have to reach over to see the time if I randomly wake up in the middle of the night.

(You can also set it up to show during certain hours in a day.)-It still allows your to insert microphone jacks.-USB-C, I personally like it since I dont have to worry about turning it around to fit anymore. (Box also comes with some adapters.)-And obviously the MiscroSD storage. Stuck a 128GB card in there upon arrival.Some downsides on the phone:-Fully made of glass. It's not cheap feeling in the slightest, but it makes you a bit more paranoid if it does fall. (Highly recommend a good case for this phone)-Wish this came with a non-Edge version. Honestly don't enjoy it that much and causes issues with a lot of screen protectors, but I couldn't pass up the sale on the phone.-Comes pre-installed with Facebook. I don't use facebook so it's just an annoying app chilling on my phone which I'd rather have completely uninstalled instead of just disabled.-Bixby button. . . well that thing is just kinda there. I don't hit it often but when I do it's just mildly inconvenient. Thankfully my case has little ridges on the button which make it easier to locate the volume when needed. The button can become an issue on some phone stands though.This phone was able to hit all the things that I want in a phone: Good camera, long battery life, adjustable storage, crisp display, and functional.All in all, I very much enjoy this phone with only minor gripes which aren't enough to make me dislike the phone at all.(Yes, this phone works with most if not all carriers.

I loved my old Samsung flip phone, but when they made the move to Android, I just couldn\'t get into them.  I read how amazing the Super AMOLED screen was, and I thought it was garbage.  It was grainy and the colors were much too garish and off.  The UI was cartoony and had weird colors.  Over the years, though, Samsung slowly stripped away the bloat, refined their screens, cleaned up their Android skin, and after all this time I can finally say that they\'ve sold me.The feel:The first thing I noticed with this phone was how amazing it feels.  It\'s crazy thin, and encased in cool, smooth curved glass.  It has just the right amount of heft to make it feel premium.  It feels like a smooth, elegant and flat pebble.  With the infinity screen it (and its brothers the S8+ and Note 8) is easily the most attractive phone I\'ve ever seen, a departure from the older Galaxy S phones which had never struck an aesthetic note with me.While the elongated shape of the phone seems odd at first, and actually makes the screen more narrow than other flagships, it works well for accessing the entire screen with one hand.  While it\'s still a stretch, it\'s more managable that way and makes the new on-screen navigation keys less obtrusive.  Speaking of the on-screen keys, I\'ve never been a fan until now.  They work well and the home "button" even has a vibrating "click" when you press it in, which I like for turning on your screen and unlocking it in one shot.The physical buttons are a bit too easy to accidentally press, which I don\'t like, and the Bixby button (which I\'ll get to later) is unnecessary and makes the volume keys harder to find.As much as I like the design, this phone NEEDS a case.  I don\'t mean that as a bad thing, although for some people I\'m sure it will be.  It\'s delicate.  The all-glass design makes it highly vulnerable to breaking, as you\'ll find reading reviews and watching drop tests.  The edge display detects accidental touches on occasion.  The volume keys are too clicky.  The phone is thin and smooth which makes it too easy to drop.  A case solves all of these problems.  Even if I didn\'t work in construction (which I do), I would put a case on this phone.  I personally went with the Spigen Rugged Armor\xa0Samsung Galaxy S8 Case, Spigen® [Rugged Armor] Galaxy S8 Case Cover with Resilient Shock Absorption and Carbon Fiber Design for Galaxy S8 (2017) - Black- 565CS21609\xa0case, which I highly recommend.  There\'s even a Youtube video where a guy drops it on tile floor and it just bounces, with no damage whatsoever.Software:For years Samsung\'s TouchWiz was bloated and ugly.  I hated the cartoony look and the garish colors (which were made worse by the extreme oversaturation of the Super AMOLED screen).  But now, with the paring down of bloat, it\'s finally become useable.  A while back Samsung also introduced a theme engine into their phones and I\'m glad they did.  I was able to change all of the default Samsung apps and menus into the black shades that I love so much.  You can even replace the icons with a different themes, although I ended up using Nova Launcher with some icons I had bought for it.I like the way Samsung has set up their apps.  They are clean, usable, intuitive, but still full of handy features.  Probably my least favorite is the Gallery, although my complaints are minor.  My issue is that the pictures are all clumped into a giant, solid wall of pictures, which makes it difficult to differentiate between each file.  The little overlays that tell you if it\'s a video or a photo, etc. are in plain white text that sometimes is hard to read against lighter pictures.  But the email app, dialer, calendar, system menus, etc. are all a pleasure to use.  Everything runs fast and I even found myself using the split screen feature for the first time ever (I had to do some calculator work and type numbers into a spreadsheet) which impressed me.There is still bloat though.  Samsung has a bunch of redundant features that mirror those of Google\'s, which aggravates me.  It would be fine if I planned on sticking to the Samsung phone ecosystem for the rest of my life, but I\'m not even close to making that commitment.  I still use all of Google\'s services, because I can use them on any Android phone.  You get Samsung Calendars, Samsung Health, Samsung Pay (which I\'ll elaborate more on), Samsung backup, and others.  It\'s mostly not a chore to use Google\'s features instead, but you really need to pay attention on things like the calendars and contacts to make sure you\'re using their Google equivilants.To be honest I didn\'t even try Bixby.  Google Assistant is more than I need, and I don\'t like having an extra home screen or a button specifically for Samsung\'s digital assistant.  Fortunately you can completely disable both the button and the service, but you have to fully enable it and set it up before you can do that.  The button is not capable of being set for anything else, so if you disable Bixby you basically end up with a useless button on the side of your phone.The Galaxy S8 has the infinity edge screen so that means it comes with the Edge shortcuts.  This is a menu you can slide out from the side of your screen and run apps, call contacts, etc. with.  There are actually a ton of extra features and screens you can download for it, but in the end I didn\'t see the need for one more thing on my screen.  That being said, I think that if a person set it up and used it regularly, it may become a handy feature.Samsung Pay is a feature I was surprised by.  My phone came with a promotional $50 credit via Samsung Pay so I was obligated to use it.  The first time I tried it, it was just like in the commercial: the cashier assured me that they couldn\'t do it, and she clumsily fumbled with the card scanner trying to figure out just how it was going to happen.  I calmly reached over and waved my phone over the reader, and like magic, it accepted payment.  I got a receipt on my phone and happily went on my way.  I\'ve used it three times total, and the first two times it worked, but the third it failed even though the reader specifically said it worked with Samsung Pay.  As cool as the first two times were, I didn\'t appreciate looking like a fool while I waved my phone around a card reader like an idiot.Hardware:Another feature I was surprised by was the fingerprint reader.  I found myself using it in my money apps, which makes them much simpler.  It\'s very quick and let me log into my Wells Fargo and Paypal apps instantly, which is convenient for checking balances, sending payments, etc.  Yes, the reader has a terrible location next to the camera.  However, this is another feature that is fixed by putting a case on your phone.  Once you have a cutout for the camera, your finger can easily find the edge of the hole where the reader lies, making it essentially a non-issue.Battery life so far has been great.  This is the seventh Android phone I\'ve owned, and I don\'t recall any of them getting phenomenal battery life.  My galaxy S5 I briefly owned (used, to replace an LG G3 with a cracked screen) got terrible life but that could have been other factors.  This one gets me through a full work day with moderate social media use, and in today\'s world that\'s the most I hope for from a cell phone.  I do have to put it on the charger in the evening, but only briefly and then it gets me through bedtime.  The battery is not removable however so keep that in mind.I\'ve never tried wireless charging before, but I did with this phone simply because the chargers are cheap and easily available, and I had to buy new cables anyway for the new USB C standard, so I snagged a wireless charger from Amazon.  I didn\'t use the Samsung charger or cable so I\'m sure it could have been faster, but in about 4 hours it filled up the battery from almost dead.  This works well for me for charging overnight, but you can\'t use your phone while it\'s lying on the pad so it might not be great for other uses.Call quality has been wonderful.  The volume of the ear speaker is actually more than I need, which is a good thing.  I\'d rather turn the audio volume down on a call then top it out and wish it would go louder.  The external speaker is adequate, not being overly quiet but not really sounding impressive in any way.  I didn\'t get any complaints on speakerphone mode.The screen almost needs its own catagory.  As I stated, for years I\'ve hated Super AMOLED.  I don\'t get how people thought the early screens looked good.  The saturation was so high, and the colors were off, so that when the brightness was up (and these displays are bright) it made my eyes bleed.  But finally, with this phone, I feel that the colors and saturation are perfect.  The screen is super bright too, and in fact Samsung\'s auto-brightening technology learns what setting you use at different light levels, making this the first Android phone I\'ve ever had auto-brightness turned on with.  The resolution is actually turned down when you buy the phone, which I recommend not messing with.  You can turn it up to 4k, but it\'s not needed and the battery will be drained more quickly.  As it is, pictures and text are extremely clear.  Everything just looks so great on this screen, I find myself staring at it sometimes just to admire it.  The infinity edge feels good too, giving it a nice rolled over feel when you swipe towards the sides.  The phone has a feature called always on display, which leaves the clock, battery percentage, and little notification icons on your screen even when it\'s locked.  The brightness is turned down so that you don\'t get screen burn-in, and I found that I liked this feature, which didn\'t seem to affect battery drain.The camera is one of the reasons I bought this phone.  I\'ve heard for a few years now that Apple and Samsung cameras are always neck and neck in quality.  In practice, I\'m mostly happy with my choice.  In well lit conditions pictures come out wonderful.  Colors are great and they\'ve very clear.  Burst shots are amazing, shooting literally 60 pictures in about a second.  Low light shots were a mixed bag, though.  The lighting in the pictures is definitely brighter than in real life, which is great, but for whatever reason once you hit a certain threshold the colors become washed out and any movement at all causes blurring.  This is a problem common to cameras and is related to aperture and shutter speed, but I honestly expected this phone camera to do better.  Perhaps it\'s a setting I need to enable, but as of right now I was a little disappointed.  However, if this phone camera is near the top of the heap, I suppose I don\'t have much choice but to accept it.Summary:I know this has been a long-winded review but a phone is a major purchase in a person\'s life and I feel like I needed to share my full experience to buyers.Overall I love this phone.  There are no major issues with it and using it is a joy.  I\'m sure it\'s partly the new phone effect, but I find myself trying to come up with reasons to use it so I can enjoy the beautiful screen and snappy performance.  It has a few minor flaws here and there, and a bit of the obligatory Samsung bloat, but so far it\'s been a wonderful experience.  I would highly recommend it.', 'title': "Best phone I've ever owned", 'star_rating': '5', 'author': 'Jonathan Dagnillo', 'date': 'November 11, 2017', 'votes': '3', 'verified_purchase': False}][{'body': "UPDATE 12/22/17: My phone is still going strong and looks pretty much the same as when I first got it. I'm still using the same Speck Candyshell Grip case and same liquid install screen protector. They are in great shape and providing enough protection tor my phone. The glitchy stuff seems to have mostly been fixed after an update. I have the unlocked version. Facebook app has been sucking big time, so I mostly access facebook through a browser and only use the facebook app to post pictures.When picking a phone over the past few months, I tried iphone 6s(hated the locked down feel and it had major battery drain with my music app that could not be fixed, so that was a deal breaker), Huawei Mate 9(Has a good camera, good battery life when battery drain isn't happening, but it isn't optimized for google apps and gets battery drain every couple weeks so I had to reset it all the time, ridiculous), LG G6(Great front camera, loved the wide-angle option, terrible front camera circa 2013 and bad connectivity with my Honda UPlay and Google play music)....And, now the Samsung S8, I have had it for a month now. It takes pretty good pictures. The Mate 9 had more detailed pics, but S8 takes better low-light photos in my experience. I'd say they are about tied for front cameras. The selfie camera is slightly better with the Mate 9 than the S8 because you can adjust more on the Mate 9 and the focus seems to be a little better when people stay in the background of a photo and not side by side. I prefer the Mate 9 photo gallery, too. It's easier to select photos to share. The speakers are a bit quiet and not as nice sounding on the S8 verses the Mate 9. Mate 9 has loud speakers with stereo option when it's side, but the S8 sounds acceptable and is much improved over my old Samsung S3. It's quieter than the LG G6 as well and comparable to the iPhone 6s. I heard the newer iPhones have stereo speakers and get pretty loud, though. But, new model iPhones are too expensive for me and offer less features than android phones at a similar price.So far, the Samsung S8 is still the better phone, it's more reliable, it does not have battery drain and the battery life is consistently allowing 6-7 hrs screen on time if all used in one day or around 5 hrs if used over 2 days. I do have to restart my phone sometimes because of minor glitches here and there. Not often, just a couple times a week, so no biggie. It does have a buggy connection with Google Play Music and Honda Uplay, but it still plays the music, it just causes the menu to flash on and off, but it's ignorable and better than not working like the G6, Mate 9 didn't have this problem, but the battery drain still makes Mate 9 a loser for me. I prefer the smaller feel of the S8. It feels very comfortable to hold as compared to the phablet phones like Mate 9. Samsung S8 has many accessories available to it that Mate 9 did not offer in the US due to lack of popularity. S8 has a car charger option, battery pack charger option, and many cases and screen protector options. I tried a couple cases and found the Speck Candyshell Grip case to be the best, I like that it gives some protection around the edge part of the screen while still leaving you full functionality and it's not bulky. I dropped my phone a couple times in the case from a couple feet up and the phone is unharmed.I used an IQ shield liquid install screen protector and that works well even though it takes longer to install. No issues with it coming loose until now. I don't like the curved phone screen, but the Samsung S8 is one of the best phones available and beats out the competition in my opinion. I got mine for close to $600 with tax, I don't think I would pay more than that. Watch for sales. It's been on sale many times since it's release. I would not recommend buying from Samsung directly. I bought one S8 from Samsung and returned it before going back and buying it again elsewhere. The return through Samsung took a month and I had to contact them a second time before they finally processed the return with some message about getting lost at the facility or something, but they still have a note about receiving it. Amazon is a good place to buy from as long as you buy directly through Amazon and not through a third party. It's nice that they give you a 30 day return period. That's the longest period I have seen anywhere.If you want an Android phone, Samsung is still the best available in the states, in my opinion. There are more nice phones available overseas, but you want to have a US warranty, easily available accessories, etc, that leaves you with Samsung, LG, Google, and iPhone for the most part. One big negative with Samsung is that screen is SUPER expensive to replace. I would not get a Samsung S8 if you are rough on your phones. There is an S8 active available through ATT and it's supposed to release for other carriers and maybe unlocked in the future from what I read.

The thoughtless design of this phone will not allow you to solve this problem. Either add a ballistic glass protector to the screen which solves the fragility of this phone but turns it into a useless phone since you have to press really hard to get the screen to respond, or not add a glass screen protector which leaves this phone subject to breaking sooner or later.

This one is just the right size to easily hold in one hand, while still having excellent screen real estate. It's not very heavy, which makes it easy to continuously read and interact on it one-handed, too, even with a heavier case.My least favorite feature is Bixby--while it has its uses, it really isn't that great at interacting with apps or hearing commands properly. It won't open non-Google apps on command, which is a huge pain, and half the time seems to mishear me even when I speak directly into the microphone and enunciate very clearly. Right now I solely use it to turn off the always on display at night, which seems like a waste for what could otherwise be a very powerful tool.

I have been a lifelong Samsung Galaxy customer and was very excited when I got my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge about a year and a half ago.

Do your research (on help forums not websites selling the product) and you will see that there  are a myriad of common problems such as pixel failure, complete screen failure, SD card corruption--the list goes on. My problems began about three months in to having the phone. So much money was spent on it that I\'m stuck with it for the foreseeable future. Samsung continues to deny responsibility for these faulty devices and will not send replacements or issue refunds. I bought mine through T-Mobile and because I\'d previously had great experiences with Samsung Galaxy products, did not opt-in to purchase the warranty. I took the phone in to an independent electronics service center several months ago and had them replace the screen on the device for $390. This took care of the notorious "pink line" these phones get across the screen inditing an impending complete screen failure for about six weeks. The line returned in all it\'s obnoxious and infuriating glory.

You may have heard from YouTubers that this is the best android device or the best they have ever used or best display on the market. Some of it is true, but there is more things that the YouTube reviewers don\'t discuss on their channel. Samsung is really slow when it comes down to pushing newer security updates and even slower pushing newer version of Android. The most important is constantly getting security updates, there are two major bugs that recently shake the smartphone industry, "KRACK (Wi-Fi Bug)" & "BLUEBORNE (Bluetooth Bug)" every single devices were affected including Apple devices. That said, Google (Nexus and Pixel) and Apple already patched their respective devices, but Samsung is still behind and that leaves vulnerable to hack. May be, you own a business and getting a device to run your business and would carry all the important documents, bank information, or any business related information, your information is at risk.Samsung has come a long way from their Galaxy S4 and Note 3 days, their software is much better now, but it is no where near close to Google\'s Pure Android that is currently being used on Nexus and Pixel. Samsung Experience/Touchwiz is bloated with unnecessary features and apps that runs in the background and eats up the battery. I have seen much better software experience on Google Pixel, and some other devices from Motorola and Sony. Some people love the Samsung\'s extra features and use them often, but others don\'t prefer and want something that is constantly being updated with security measures. There are other issues too related to Samsung Experience (former Touchwiz); I have found various bugs that are not annoying at all, and doesn\'t hinder day to day use, but they are there. Samsung needs to streamline the experience, and curate it towards what consumers really want and prefer. I do not recommend this device.If you have the device that is working perfectly fine, I suggest you wait it out until next Galaxy or Pixel 3 or get Sony Xperia XZ1. And if your device is broken and need something immediate and wants to spend money, it is entirely up to you.', 'title': 'Avoid and wait it out until Pixel 3 comes out', 'star_rating': '2', 'author': 'Tech Savvy', 'date': 'November 4, 2017', 'votes': '5', 'verified_purchase': True}, {'body': 'For context, in the past three years, I have used a Samsung Galaxy S5 and an LG G5 for my personal line, and an iphone 5s for my work line.  I have been using the S8 for a little while now and it\'s a mix of upgrades and downgrades from my previous phones.  Before I go into my review, I would like to point out that this review is for the second S8 phone that I got.  The first one (which I ordered from samsung.com) arrived defective, where a dime-sized portion of the touch screen was completely unresponsive out of the box.  While I\'m sure every phone manufacturer will ship some defective devices, this has definitely lowered my confidence in Samsung\'s quality control.  Also, the Samsung customer support is the worst I\'ve ever dealt with, and I spent 9 phone calls and over 13 hours trying to get the issue resolved.  If you do buy the device, buy from a third party (amazon, best buy, verizon, - just not samsung\'s online store) Here is my review of my second (non-defective) s8 device:1. The screen - First the good: It gets relatively bright outdoors, and is a high quality screen.  Now the bad:  The curve of the screen is the worst feature of the phone.  Sure, it makes the phone look fancy, but it actually makes the phone functionally worse.  When watching full screen videos, you will always have a  distracting glare on the curved edges of the screen.  This effectively means that every movie you watch in landscape mode will have the top and bottom of the movie distorted and annoying to watch.  Second, I have occasionally accidentally activated the back button with my hand when reaching over to the far edge of the screen, and this is definitely because the curve of the screen allows this.  The curve also makes it more difficult to get a glass screen protector that will make full contact with the screen.  And when you do find one, you\'ll still end up with a non-contact spot if you dont install it precisely in the right spot.  (I wasted a screen protector trying to find the right position.)2 - Performance - The performance of the phone is pretty great.  I haven\'t had any hiccups and everything seems to be running smoothly.3 - Battery Life - So far the battery is better than any of the phones I have previously had.  It gets me through the day with roughly 45% left at the end of the day.  That\'s from 7:30am to around 11pm.  I\'d estimate I probably use around 4 to 5 hours of screen-on time during a full day.  I really dont like that the battery is not user-replaceable, but that\'s the world we live in now.  Based on how batteries degrade over time,  I suspect that a year from now, the battery life will not be as good as it is now, and I will have no way to replace it on my own.4 - Cameras - The front and back cameras work well.  I do miss the dual back camera that my LG G5 had, because once in a while a wide angle shot would have been useful.  If you have never used a dual back camera before, you obviously wont miss it.  But if you have, you might be in the same boat wishing that samsung had included it.5 - Fingerprint scanner - The offset location of the fingerprint scanner is odd.  If you use the phone without a case on it, this will probably annoy you as locating it by feel is not super easy.  I always have a case on it though, and this solves the problem.  With the case on it, my finger is immediately  able to find the edge of the cutout in the case, landing it directly on the scanner.  As long as your finger lands on it, the fingerprint scanner is actually quite responsive.6. Bixby - I have only used the voice assistant bixby a few times, so these are only my initial impressions.  I have used Bixby pretty successfully using voice commands to have it read and send text messages without me having to look at or touch the phone.  This is better than my experience with google now.  The bixby button is annoyingly easy to accidentally press though.  It hasn\'t been a consistent issue for me yet, but if my fingers dont learn to avoid it, I may start looking to see if there are any workarounds to remap or disable the button.7 - Build and design quality - This is where all of the professional review sites have gotten it wrong.  Most of the review sites praise this phone for "feeling premium" and having a great design. I\'m sorry to say but they clearly have no understanding of what premium build quality is.  If they mean it feels like solid glass, yeah it does, because it is.  Both the front and back are glass.  Sure my fingers feel the glass too, but solid and smooth doesn\'t mean premium.  What my brain knows when it\'s holding glass is that it\'s holding something fragile.  I\'m an engineer, and this is how I would design a phone if I wanted it to shatter in a drop.  The curved screen makes it worse, as it\'s significantly more likely that an impact will occur against the glass.  Also, because of the curve, there are no phone cases that will wrap around the sides of the phone.  This means even with a case there is a good chance you will damage your phone if you drop it.  If you buy this phone, you should probably also get a accidental damage warranty, and expect to pay something like a $100 deductible on top of that if/when you drop the phone.  I hope this design fad goes away, because I would much prefer a phone with a flat screen and an aluminum or plastic back.8 - Water Resistance - The phone is supposed to be water resistant, but honestly I didn\'t have the guts to check, so I\'ll have to take their word for it.Overall - This is a mix of good and bad features.  The problem is, there aren\'t that many device options for a Verizon user who prefers android.  I would have gone with the LG G6, but after the build quality and GPS issues that I (and many other people, apparently) experienced with the G5, I dont really want to buy another LG phone.  The Moto Z2 series looks good, and I\'d love to have a phone I don\'t have to be concerned about dropping, but the phone is bigger than I\'d like.  The S8 is a nice size.  Given the other options out there, I don\'t regret my s8 purchase, but I don\'t love the phone, and I\'m not confident that I wouldn\'t have been happier with the Moto Z2 or G6.', 'title': 'Mix of good and bad.

It may or may not have been "unlocked by Samsung", but that claim is certainly misleading as it leads you to believe that you are receiving a generic universal phone.  Verizon is CDMA, the other more common carriers are GSM and they are not compatible, though some phones offer some of the frequencies of both types.  When I put my AT&T sim card in it, it seemed to work, but the display came up with a Verizon welcome page and there was an annoying "not a Verizon sim card" error message in the notification tray.  You could force the error to go away, but it always came back when you powered up the phone.  I did not trust that I would get true GSM performance out of a Verizon phone and might experience slow or degraded performance due to a shortage of available frequencies so I returned the phone and ordered a true unlocked generic phone directly from Samsung.

All I can tell you is that I needed to replace my 3-year-old Galaxy Alpha, so when the Galaxy S8 went on sale over Labor Day weekend, I walked into a big box retailer (whose name rhymes with "guest guy") intending to buy one of the lesser priced prior year models like the G7. However when I walked into the display area, the S8 winked at me, it was love at first sight, I was stunned and floored by the beauty, grace, forward-looking design, advanced features including VR, and vibration control video camera performance that reminded me (in my simplistic estimation) of Hollywood steadicam, a far cry from my prior Alpha\'s performance in that regard.  (Plus, simply, when it comes to Android, where obsolescence unfortunately happens rather quickly, newer is better, because it gives you longer usable life.)  I bought.  I haven\'t looked back.  The two of us have been joined at the hip (literally) for almost 2 months, as I mated it with a very inexpensive, minimal size holster case that visually recedes out of the way to allow the stunning beauty of this phone to shine (while continuing to buffer it from shocks).Phone setup was a breeze, as I merely unplugged the micro SIM from my Galaxy Alpha, plugged it into the S8, and my cellular carrier was auto-configured by the S8, so you really can\'t hope for anything cleaner than that. Plus the simplified migration utility that came with the S8  copied over my files and photos, my contacts lists and more, from my prior phone.I spent a fair amount of time optimizing app power use.  The S8 now uses minimal power while I\'m out and about, and at night it takes no more than a few minutes to bring to full charge again, ready for next day.A chief buying criteria for me was camera performance. I found amazing praise in the comparative reviews published at GSMArena, a prominent factor in my willingness to purchase the S8.  Camera performance matches or exceeds reviewers\' expectations.Unlock methods:  fingerprint / face scan / iris scan / voice scan / nearby device detection / draw pattern / type a PIN.

Fingerprint wasn\'t working for a while but Samsung fixed with a firmware push (Nov 2018).I\'m a guy who has consciously avoided the phablet phenomenon as I can\'t imagine carrying a massive hunk of hardware wherever I go.

The whole thing is made of Gorilla glass, which is known to spider crack extremely easily.  Crazy that this design was actually approved, I don't care how strong you think your glass is it will never be more durable than metal/plastic.  Any benefits are overshadowed by the fact this is the most fragile phone ever to hit the market.The design of the phone makes it way easier for it to slip out of your pocket.  I can't ever remember having my phone fall out of my pocket (I am sure it has happened, but nothing became of it IE breaks), but I had to constantly be aware of my phone in my pocket/take it out and put it on the table because when I sat it immediately started to slip out.  I think it is because this phone is larger vertically and smaller horizontally compared to most phones.  I have owned many phones, and this has never been a problem until the moment I put this phone in my pocket.My phone fell out of my pocket while sitting, it was a drop between 2 and 2.5 feet, and it cracked in 2 corners, one corner that was not even apart of the initial impact.  The fact a corner that had no major impact whatsoever (a fall of maybe 4 inches after the first corning hit the ground) cracked was alarming to say the least.  Shame on me for not having the case on it (I literally had the phone for 3 hours, did not make it home yet and my case I purchased was at home)...  However, few weeks later it slipped out again, with a case on, and the whole front of the phone shattered.... Again a drop no more than 2.5 feet.Insurance on this phone is an absolutely must, or I guarantee you will not own this phone in a working fashion very long.

Coming from an iPhone 6s, this is truly an upgrade worth getting for the price.Firstly, the screen is absolutely the best you can get on the market on any phone right now. It has a beautiful 5.8" Quad HD+ Super AMOLED (2960x1440 resolution). This makes the colors, contrast, and blacks more vivid and pure.  The pure black is pixels turned off when they aren\'t needed. This gives an amazing black color and helps a bit with the battery not needing to display extra pixels. The screen also employs Samsung\'s "Infinity Display". This creates a nearly bezel-less design on the front screen which gives can provide more information on the screen. They have removed their physical buttons, but it\'s really noticeable after a few minutes. A feature that I have come to use quite a bit (with widgets and fast opening of certain apps) is the Edge. I am very glad they\'ve introduced the Edge screen onto the regular S series. If you don\'t prefer it, you can also turn it off. Samsung has also added an Always On Display. This shows the date and time along with notifications you receive. This doesn\'t consume hardly any battery life (with only losing around 1% an hour)Software: Out of the box, it runs Android 7.0 (Nougat). It also does come with Samsung\'s \'controversial\' TouchWiz skin. However, they\'ve greatly improved the experience and fluidity of the software. I have not noticed any lag with using it for some time now. It\'s responsive and I personally enjoy the look of it. You can always download different launchers to your liking. S8 users should be able to get Andriod 8.0 (Oreo) within early next month.Hardware: this phone sports 64gb (along with MicroSD slot of up to 256gb of expandable storage) and 4gb of RAM. I am really happy with the amount of RAM and space that\'s offered. With my iPhone, I\'ve always had to load up the pages I was on again due to the low RAM, along with the very disappointing 16gb of Space (12gb in usable). This limited to using my old phone for daily news and chat apps, while hardly being able to play many games. This is definitely not an issue with the S8! I\'ve downloaded many things that I previously couldn\'t and I still have a beast amount of storage left. It\'s also IP68 certified dust and water resistant.Charging: I love the Adaptive Fast Charge that Samsung offers for their products. It charges my phone quickly without it getting hot. The battery capacity is 3000mAh and fast for hours. I can go around 4-6 hours of Screen On Time while going around 12 hours in general. I am very happy with this as regular charging seems quite dated to have it on any (premium) phone.Camera: This Camera is truly beautiful and very detailed. I am surprised by how much I am using it. The photos are clear and crisp all with just one snap. Selfies are also detailed and great to look at. 8MP AF for Front and Dual Pixel 12MP AF for the Rear.Security: The S8 employs two different biometrics for unlocking your phone (along with the regular number/line password). The one we\'ve known for some time is the fingerprint scanner (to which they have moved it right next to the camera. This is not a preferable location as I do hit the Camera often) and the new Iris scanner. The Iris scanner has been quite convenient, though you do have to be a bit close (and in light) for it to work.Voice Command: Samsung has added a new \'Bixby\' to their phone line that is to be used similarly to Amazon\'s Alexa, Apple\'s Siri, and Google\'s Assistant. There is a dedicated button on the left side of the phone that allows for Bixby to hear your voice for your questions/command. This button will also open Bixby home, which shows some news, events, personal widgets, and Bixby \'levels\'. That is right, you can increase the levels gained on Bixby by using it and helping it with feedback. This doesn\'t lock you behind any level requirements to use it to the full. This only allows customization unlocks. This has been a controversial feature so far (as many find it unnecessary), though I have been fairly enjoying it. I really use it for screenshots. If you don\'t prefer it, there are apps to redirect the Bixby button to use it for other apps.Overall, the experience is astounding and I wouldn\'t trade it for anything else really.

I did not like the over size and weight iphone 6+ and I did not like the small screen size of the iphone 6. The S8 is much smaller and lighter and has a bigger screen which is amazing. The display is way better than iphone 6+ and also is OLED which iphone doesn’t have and maybe the next gen iphone will have on its most expensive model. Pictures and movies look far superior than on the iphone. I needed and unlocked phone so when I travel to other countries I just drop in a sim card from that country and not have to pay roaming charges etc.The S8 supports wireless charging in which I bought an after market wireless charger stand for $16 and works excellent and also can charge while on its side which is nice when watching movies. The screen looks like miniature movie theatre when watching full length movies and most movies fill the entire screen.The memory can expand to 2 TB when available but I just stuck in 128 gig sd card for now. I have lots of FLAC lossless music and it takes up lots of space and also have lots of HD movies. By the way Apple does not support FLAC lossless music which is the most prolific lossless music format available. And also the S8 video is 4k so that takes a lot of memory. You need to up the resolution in settings as the default is not the highest.The benchmarks show that the S8 is twice as fast as the iphone 6+. The battery life seems good but did not have it long enough. Some people say that the battery life is average but with the much higher speed and higher resolution graphics, the tradeoff of slightly less battery life is fine with me. Also the weight factor and size is important to me.It has a built in pulse sensor and O2 sensor which works good and can calculate stress level also.When plugged into my Dell I7 notebook it sees the internal memory and the SD card so easy to load files from the computer. However when plugged into my Acer Aspire I5 desk computer it sees the S8 but not the internal or external memory. Also when using my wifi file transfer app it only can access the internal memory and does not see the external memory.The fingerprint sensor works excellent and after a few times I had no problem putting my finger on the sensor and not accidently on the camera lens. I don’t know why people complain as it is a no brainer after a few times only. I find the fingerprint sensor to be very fast and 100% accurate. However I use the retina sensor to unlock the phone and works excellent also and very fast and 100% accurate so I don’t use the fingerprint sensor unless I have to.I do not know how the new iphone 8 will compare of course but with the new iphone OS 11 you won’t be able to run any 32 bit programs so many programs will not work after the upgrade. The S8 also retains the headphone jack which is important to me and apple got rid of it of course forcing you to use and adapter. The S8 uses the  C type usb connector which is much better and more robust than the micro usb that most phones come with and now appears to be the industry standard for portable devices.The phone is also waterproof to a certain extent but I did not test it and not sure how water will not get into the headphone jack. The earphones that come with the phone are throw away type but maybe ok for phone call and with good earphone and or headphone the sound is excellent with FLAC lossless music.I like the fact that I can open multiple windows and switch back and forth quickly which Apple OS can’t do and also there is always a back button which somehow Apple feels is not necessary so going back to a previous page etc. is impossible unless the app itself contains a back button. It is also easier to add items in groups than the Apple OS. Lots of other features makes this phone easier to use and manage than the Apple OS.As soon as you get this phone you need to buy a case and a good screen protector obviously due to the front and back being glass. The case would make the size a little bigger but not as big and cumbersome as the 6+.I have not used the Bixby and the left Bixby button should be user programmable so the user has control as to what you want it to do. There are other options to use other than Bixby of course.To conclude, there is no perfect phone but this has the fewest problems of the phones I’ve encountered up until now and I bought this on sale making the price much cheaper than the comparable iphone also.', 'title': 'Best phone out there compared to others.', 'star_rating': '5', 'author': 'space case', 'date': 'September 5, 2017', 'votes': None, 'verified_purchase': False}, {'body': 'This is a good phone with some major issues.First good:--Very nice display and good sound--Good camera, especially in low light.--Looks really good.Now to the bad:--Some of the applications that used to run before without problems, now take huge resources and stop working, e.g. requires rebooting the phone every time I want to use Amazon Prime Video.--Display while good is fingerprint and dust magnet and all these things reflect in sunlight making viewing experience less than optimal, to put it mildly.--It may be T-Mobile specific but data connection settings do not include both 4th and 6th standards for the network, so I had to create my own setting for it-- The biggest thing the phone front camera and back flash (as well as all camera software) stopped working after only two months. After analyzing the issue (Samsung has internal hardware checking menu), I found out that it was hardware issue. It was confirmed and fixed by Samsung center in Manhattan (Guys at "Samsung 837" are great.

It is as perfect as a company has done creating the perfect smartphone for me.This phone is PERFECT in my hand. Its screen is big but you wouldn't be able to tell because it is in such a small footprint. The phone is light. The worst thing about the design is how slippery it is. But a skin or case will fix that.The bezelless display makes it look leagues above every phone out there other then the Pixel 2, Essential Phone, iPhone X and LG V30. To me however the iPhone X and the S8 are tied aesthetically. They both represent the next generations of what is a smartphone. I almost bought a LG G6 before I even held this phone and thank god I didn't buy it. It doesn't compare aesthetically at all. I can list many reasons why this phone is better then all phones other then the Note 8. The V30 is debatable. And the iPhone X isn't available to the masses yet.The screen is AMAZING. Which everyone knows Sammy Mobile creates the best screens around. However, I came from a Note 5 to this thing and could instantly see the difference. Which is crazy because I didn't think the screen could get any better at a QHD resolution (this screen is only QHD+ because of the 16:9 aspect ratio).At first I thought I would hate the aspect ratio. I love squarish phones so much and prefer my displays to be more square then rectangle. But I actually got used to it fast. Content on this looks so good with that aspect ratio. Youtube, Netflix, Amazon Video and the native Samsung video app all support a zoom in function. At first I was thinking this would be terrible because it would look stretched and things would be missing I needed to see. But no. They did an AMAZING job with the zoom feature. It's the reason I was finally sold on this aspect ratio. With out it I would have never gotten this phone.The cameras are amazing. The pixel is the only one that compares. Even the iPhone X looks night and day compared to this phone. It may be preference but shots from this phone are so much better imo.I waited a month before I wrote this review to see if the phone would start slowing down or stuttering. Nope! I run a launcher and a custom notification shader and my phone doesn't even seemed bothered. My Note 5 slowed down and sputtered when I customized the heck out of it. My S8+? No problem.The fingerprint scanner, iris scanner and facial recognition are all amazing. I have used them all and had no problems. Yes photos can trick facial recognition. However I am way more worried about a stranger robbing me or stealing it then I am of someone I know taking it. So facial recognition to me, has gotten a bad rep on this phone. As well as the fingerprint scanner. I pull out my phone conveniently with my finger in the same spot as the fingerprint scanner. So to me this design works. When I am using it two handed I just slide my left hand up and it really isn't that bad. But it is the biggest complaint on this phone. That says A LOT!Battery life has been phenomenal. I crank it to max brightness. Wifi is usually on, NFC and bluetooth. I am still averaging like 4-5 1/2 screen on time.With a bezelless gorgeous 2K HDR screen, 4 gb Ram, Samsung Pay, the cameras, the security features (Samsung Knox, Pass, Secure Folder and the various biometric locks ), the light skin over Android, the specs that future proof it (LTE-A/LTE+, Bluetooth 5.0), big battery with great longevity (battery cycle count a lot higher then all phones before it) and wireless charging, HEADPHONE Jack, exedra exedra this is as perfect as a cell phone as you can get imo. Front facing stereo speakers are the only missing feature I can think of. But even then the speaker on this is really nice.As you can tell I love this phone.

One feature in particular I was looking for was barometric altimeter and that works well in this phone.  Ride with GPS app can keep accurate topography on my rides.  I have no interest in adopting another voice assistant in my life though, so the bixby stuff is kind of annoying.  I removed the button actuator from my case because it was being pressed when I took the phone from my pocket or just whenever I picked it up to do something else.  The bicycle mount that I use with it also would press that button.  The moto X touch free voice assistant is superior to the button.I'm not sure that the curved screen adds real utility for me.  its cool but I  think I'd prefer the phone to be flat so that a simple glass protector can be used even if that makes the phone a couple of mm wider.The VR viewer device works really nice with this phone and its hi res screen, and the battery life is considerably better than what I was used to with MotoX phones.  Although the curved screen is kinda cool, it makes using a conventional glass protective cover impossible, and I have now shattered my phone after 4 weeks and this is a really expensive screen to fix.  I'm having a little buyers remorse right now.  Turns out that since I am inside the 90 day warranty, samsung will repair it for about $206 wihich is cheaper than buying a kit on Ebay.  Packing it up to send away for that tomorrow.  5 - 7 business day estimated turn around.  The S8 Active is interesting but more than 2X the price.

THEN I drove off from home with the phone on the roof one day and a neighbor returned it to me in tact.  Just a tiny scratch on one corner of the front glass.Full disclosure, I did drop this phone several times before the killer drop which was a stupid situation where I was holding it over my head to get wifi signal over a barrier..

The GS8 already has that going back to the Note 7, as well as having iris scanning which the X doesn\'t have.Did anyone see that jerk CEO Tim Cook brag about the X\'s feature of their interactive emoticons, using a pile of crap with a funny face?

The Wireless Hotspot feature works even if you don't pay your carrier for the privilege.4.  The Screen is sharp and bright, just like prior Galaxy phones.The negatives:1.  No hard button on the front.  I really appreciated that the earlier Galaxy phones that had a physical button.  I like the tactile feedback that a physical button gives you.  It allows you to wake your phone without having to look at it to make sure your hand is in the right place.  That tactile feedback is missing on this phone.  Also, on this phone, to wake the phone you must press the virtual button TWICE, then you must swipe, and then you must type in your passcode/PIN.  That means a total of FOUR actions just to get the phone to the home screen.  That's just stupid.2.  No user replaceable battery.  This is simply inexcusable.  I know that they big companies want you to throw away your phone every two years and buy a new one, but that is incredibly wasteful and unnecessary.  There is nothing about the design of this phone that mandates a battery that cannot be replaced by the user.  It would have been very easy to design the phone to have a user removable rear cover.  Even wireless charging can be accomplished with a user replaceable battery.  I had wireless charging on my Galaxy S3 and S4, both of which had a user replaceable battery.3.  Oddly sized:  This phone is too tall and too narrow.  As a result, it does not easily fit into my pocket and will fall out fairly easily as well.4.  Oddly shaped:  The waterfall feature on the screen has an appeal that's similar to the appeal of curved TV sets.  Initially, it looks interesting, but you quickly come to realize that it heightens glare and distorts the image.  In the case of this waterfall screen, it distorts the images at the edges.  It also makes it almost impossible to get a case that will protect the phone from screen damage when it is dropped.5.  Bixby Button:  Bixby is a Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri.  There's a dedicated Bixby button, which is located directly across from the power button, which makes it super easy to inadvertently push when you're pushing the power button.  Samsung just recently made it possible to disable, but not remap, the button.  But, in order to do so, you *must* create a Samsung account, share some personal information with Samsung, and link Bixby to the account.  Until you do that, you cannot get to the screen that allows you to disable the button.  Again, this is stupid.  If Bixby is so great, people will choose to use it.  Samsung shouldn't need to force people to do so.In the end, even though I got a smoking $574 Black Friday price on this phone from Amazon.com, I'm going to send it back and either keep my S6, or upgrade to S7 instead.", 'title': 'What a piece of junk!!!', 'star_rating': '1', 'author': 'M.

It could be cool technology when they do a 360 degree wrap around screen that covers the back as well, but in its current state I don't really get the point. It does look pretty though (is that the only point...?). Glare is kind of an issue. Bixby is completely awful and I can't believe Samsung locked out the button so people can't reprogram it to do something useful.

I was hesitant at first, given some of the negative reviews here and also elsewhere on the web. I have now owned the phone for over a month, here are my impressions.1. Red screen: This was one of my main concerns, since many people seem to have received phones with red screens. The phone does have a setting that is called "blue light filter", which I find awesome because it tends to protect your eyes from the damage these screens cause especially when used in the dark. With this setting turned on, the colors do tend to look reddish at first, but you quickly get used to it. Otherwise, you can turn it off and the colors of the screen are simply amazing. So I had absolutely no issues here. The screen resolution and size are exceptional.2. Fingerprint scanner: It\'s on the back of the phone, right next to the camera. At first, I\'ll admit it was a bit inconvenient, since I had some trouble putting my finger on the scanner rather than the camera. However, the minute I got a case for the phone, this stopped being an issue, since the case border is useful as a guide to put my finger in the right spot. At this point, the scanner is great, it easily recognizes the fingers I have registered and is many times better and faster than the one I had in my prior phone. I am 100% used to it now and even look for the scanner in the back whenever I hold a different phone. So again, no issues here, even if there are a ton of reviews saying that people can never ever get used to it. I actually like the location of the scanner now.3. Size: I had a Galaxy S5, which had a 5.1" screen. This one has a 5.8" screen and feels much better. The S8 feels long at first but the dimensions "make sense" and you quickly get used to it. There\'s even an advantage here: I normally carry my phone in my front pants pocket and since the S8 a bit longer I can grab it more easily than I did the S5. I have found the S8 much more comfortable than the S8+ both to carry and to hold, and I haven\'t missed the extra half inch that the S8+ has.4. Hardware and performance: This is a top-of-the-line phone and I have had absolutely no issues with lag, freezing, quality, or anything I can think of. Videos look amazing, the camera and the camera software are quite more advanced than I am as a user, the sound from the speaker is missing nothing, and the sensors (iris, heartbeat, light, focus and so on) all work perfectly. The phone also comes standard with AKG headphones and they are by far the best I\'ve had, both in sound quality and in the materials used, I feel like they will last for a long time. I also had a problem at first with things like the edge bar getting in the way whenever I was playing a game, but it was a user error: the phone comes with game mode, which easily and quickly hides the edge bar while in a game, so it doesn\'t get in the way, and the minute you leave the game the edge bar is back on its own. I bought the phone in Coral Blue and the phone color is very attractive.5. Some things I do not like (note: all these things are minor issues for me, that\'s why I gave the phone 5 stars):5A) Sometimes I don\'t get notification sounds if, for example, I receive a message after several hours of not receiving one (in the mornings, for example). I just notice that the notification is there all of a sudden. I have tested this and it in fact happes with several apps. I\'m sure this will have an easy fix with a software update, but for now I cannot trust notification sounds 100%. Note: this is only true of the sound, the notifications do appear correctly all the time.5B) Like I said before, the headphones are absolutely great. However, they have a quite sturdy and long cover for the jack, and using the phone in landscape mode with the headphones connected is a bit uncomfortable since the cover gets in the way quite a bit. This is inconvenient but by no means a huge issue.5C) Bixby is still very limited, but the phone comes with Google Assistant, which I have found even better than Siri at times. I would just prefer that the physical Bixby button could be configured to use with Google Assistant. It\'s also a minor issue, since I can always press and hold the home button and get Google Assistant just as easily.5D) There are some web pages where, if you\'re watching a video in landscape mode and then turn to portrait, the video will not resize. This can be solved by hitting the back button but it\'s inconvenient. Note: I found that this is true also for the iPhone 8 that my buddy has. Also note: this happens only in *some* pages, most of them work fine.5E) I was surprised at first to learn that there were no tempered glass screen protectors at the Samsung store for this phone. Then it made more sense, since the screen shape does not allow for a good protector. I have bought a couple of relatively inexpensive ones but they don\'t quite fit the phone or get loose very quickly. I would recommend that you save your money and don\'t buy any of those off-brand screen protectors for this phone, they won\'t work. I would prefer to have a screen protector for this phone but I can\'t have one, unless it\'s the plastic one Samsung sells.6. In summary: The phone has an extremely attractive design and mine gets noticed quite a bit, so socially it\'s great. It\'s also an impressive piece of hardware, so when I\'m alone I also enjoy it quite a bit. I have been told that my voice sounds clearer to the other person when I\'m in a call since I have had this phone; I can also say that I can hear the other person much more clearly in this phone. The camera is outstanding, the sound and video quality are impressive, and the phone itself is very comfortable to use. Also, I came from a Galaxy S5 and the transfer of data and settings from that phone to the S8 was very quick and easy, and I was impressed at how much this felt like it was my own phone right from the beginning. I would definitely recommend this phone above any others in the market right now.', 'title': 'Definitely get this phone', 'star_rating': '5', 'author': 'A.

I took a photo of another sunset! This one was taken without any special filter and yet it beautifully captures the layers of the fading colors - S8+ exceeds it’s low-light capabilities of it's predecessors!  In addition, there are some new photo functions (swipe left in ‘Camera’). I love that as an inner (or Yelp) ‘Foodies’, I have my very own food filter to snap as many lunch or dinners as I pleased!

There are 10 levels to Hi, Bixby and I never got past level 3. Another problem was the news feed (which will probably not bother others as it did me) but every headline in the news feed was on top of a photo, so I had to process a picture as well as read a headline printed over variable colors. Add to that, instead of the feed being one box over another box it is in a hop-scotch format: one box over two side-by-side boxes over one box over two side-by-side boxes over....So my eyes have to jump all over the place to read a headline.

However, as a photographer who shoot everything from landscape to macros to portraits, I must admit the phone display is absolute garbage. And I knew this coming in as some reveiwers such as MKBHD warned about the warmer and more saturated colors of this phone, particularly the red tones. Here's where the issue lies for me. I shoot a photo of a couple during an engagement session on my digital equipment, throw the picture on my computer with calibrated monitors and color grade to my liking yet maintaining accurate skin tones to the best of my abilities. When I upload the edited images to my phone, the skin color looks like a pumpkin barfed on an magenta crayon. I checked the images on an a few iPhones and LG phones and they look very close to how they did on my calibrated monitor. This poses several problems, 1. people who view my work on Galaxy phones think I suck at photography unless they realize that their display is at fault and 2. When taking raw images on the phone and editing with readily available apps, which is why I picked this phone, the colors I see and believe to be accurate isn't accurate at all! So my workflow would be to take the raw image on the phone, throw on my computer to edit and load back on the phone to share, you see how the workflow is slowed down considering I wanted all that work to be done promptly on the phone? I will admit that for landscape and macro where saturated colors actually enhances the images (depending on personal taste), this is a non issue.

Needless to say the transition from having no bloat to a bunch of Samsung bloat took awhile to get use to. Touchwiz or tizen is not as bad as it use to be but the part I found most annoying was Samsung's very own so, Bixby.  Samsung even gave Bixby it's own button to access it but I found myself always pressing it on accident and unintentionally. When I would use an ai it would always be Google assistant it seemed more practical than Bixby. Needless to say Bixby is still young and has much to grow but it didn't really leave a lasting impression for me.BatteryThe battery on the s8 was not bad considering it's a quad hd bezleless screen.  When default settings(quad hd resolution mid brightness) were active on the battery I would get around 4 hours of screen on time.  When I changed the setting to full us resolution and low brightness I was able to get through a whole day.  The standby time on this phone is also great. My phone would have around 10% battery life before I went to sleep and when I would wake up it's only be at 8%.CameraUnlike most manufacturers Samsung didn't choose to go dual cameras on this device which wasn't really a bad thing.  This is one of the phones that proves more is not always better(more being more cameras). The back camera does a great job in low light performance and in my opinion still took better photos than the iPhone 7. The selfie camera was adequate it wasn't great in my experience cause Samsung software tends to smooth out the image alot when using the selfie camHardwareThis is the area where I just did not have a good experience with this phone. For starters the fingerprint reader.  I'm not going to complain about the placement but rather how accurate it is.  I had to same the same finger twice and I still can't unlock it on the first try.  I am frequently having to unlock my phone with my password instead cause of how many times it fails to read my fingerprint.  The charging port was another issue I was having. Samsung tends to promote wireless charging for a reason and it's because their charging port is not that great. I use the charger that came in the box and my phone sometimes doesn't even charge or sometimes it doesn't even read that it's a quick charge compatible charger. I tried other chargers but it was even harder to charge.  The other bad part of their hardware is that Bixby button it just isn't that needed and would have been better if the button could be remapped to some other function.DesignOverall the best part of this phone is the design. Samsung s8's design are in a class of their own due to those super thin bezles no one has really been able to match.

I am a poor college student but my phone that I had previously was not powerful enough for my nursing clinical. I waited to review this device because I wanted to run it through nursing clinical before I have it a good review.1). This phone is a very practical size. It has a large enough screen to be pleasant and easy to use buy without being clumsy in hand. The Super Amoled display is great the best on the market simply put.2). Software and Performance: So we all know Samsung has had its software issues in the past. It is just a really heavy and poorly optimized skin. On top of that, still being on 7.0 Nougat and not 7.1.1 or 7.1.2 is kind of frustrating. They are improved versions of Android with much better battery optimizations. As far as Samsung Experience is concerned, this is a huge improvement from previous iterations of Touchwiz. It is much smoother and more lightweight than before and it helps. With that being said it still has stutter issues. Not lag but stutter. No lag meaning there is no delay response when opening apps and such. But it does fail to open some apps smoothly sometimes. The Snapdragon 835 and 4 GB of ram do enough however to power through everything. I have an app on my phone that we use during clinicals. It has an entire library or medical terminology and practices that we need to be able to call upon at a moment's notice. This phone does not fail me. I also game frequently and this device blows through it.3). Camera: People and reviewers have complained that the camera is just not improved enough. Hmm...thats funny because a lot of those same reviewers have also said it is still one of the top 3 cameras on the market. It is very reliable and takes some incredible pictures. I use it a lot in class for some blackboard notes. Clear as day even in dark conditions. Just a great great camera overall.4)Battery: This has been a very controversial aspect of this phone. Some people have had good battery life, and some have had not so good battery life. I personally get good battery life but not stellar. I keep the phone on 1440p resolution because that is what I paid for, and I get about 4 1/2 hours of battery life. I wake up at 6:30 every morning and my phone lasts me tulle about 11 at night with about 20% to spare. I have had and seen better but the battery has been able to at least keep it's charge very well despite being several months old now.5). Overall: This device is a solid overall package. I think it nails most things but has a few of its querks. A lot of people will be wondering if the Galaxy S8 should be dumped for the Not 8. I would say no. I would personally wait for the S9 or in my case the Note 9. This phone is basically a smaller Note 8 with a single rear camera and no S pen.

At first, I wasn't sure how the whole curved screen thing was going to play out but after just one day with it I was already questioning if I could ever go back to a normal flat screen. It's awesome.Battery (5/5): I put this thing through its paces. The first few days I used Youtube a ton and played a bunch of games to get a feel for how fast the battery drains. To make it short and to the point, you could obviously drain the whole battery if you turned the brightness to max and just played graphics intensive games for hours, but if we're talking about moderate to heavy use for the average adult then this thing will last all day without even making it to critical levels. I think the lowest I've seven seen the battery after a normal day's use (lots of texting, some phone calls, a few games and some Youtube videos) is like 40%.Storage (5/5): Pretty simple to review this. 64GB is probably enough for most people, and even if it's not you can insert a microSD card.Call clarity (4/5): At first, I didn't realize I had the HD Calling feature on. This made the caller's voice seem super digital and weird, I didn't like it. After I switched it off, it improved the quality but it wasn't the best I've heard. By no means is it bad, just not the best,Feel (4/5): It's a long phone, so if you have small hands you might want to play around with it a little before buying. I have large hands so it isn't as much of a problem for me, but I can see why this might become an issue for others.Speaker quality (5/5): I was pleasantly surprised by the volume and quality of the speakers. Don't get me wrong, they are cell phone speakers, but compared to other phones the S8's sound is above average.Feel (5/5): This thing is sleek. I bought a minimalist case for it because I loved the way it felt in my hand. A few times, I had a moment of panic because I couldn't feel that it was still in my pocket. If you are prone to dropping your phone, I suggest getting a protection plan or a rugged case. I have not dropped mine yet, but I can easily imagine a single drop on a hard surface from waist level breaking the screen if it lands directly on it.

Specifically, the native dynamic range is very limited, and the HDR feature seems to be faked in software (with poor results) as opposed to "real" HDR where multiple images are captured at different exposures and blended together into one.When shooting at night, areas around light bulbs are bleached. When shooting during the day in contrasty scenes, the blue sky is bleached white, even with the HDR mode on.My 2014 iPhone 6 plus does not have a problem capturing the dynamic range of these scenes without bleaching, and takes much better overall pictures (despite the lower pixel count) because it has real HDR that works well.I even tried a 3rd party true HDR camera app. But, in the darkest exposure setting the areas around light bulbs at night are bleached. Basically, the camera\'s hardware just doesn\'t have the range to do it.Also, the camera has awful halo effects at night, regardless of whether I use the stock camera app or the paid premium one. Streetlights, etc. have horizontal lines that run across the screen from end to end.I am thinking of getting rid of this brand new phone because the camera is so sub-par compared to my past iPhones. In fact, my iPhone 4S has a preferable camera in some ways because it does HDR properly.The 1080p video is also inferior to my 2014 iPhone 6 plus. There is a notable lack of detail and contrast in the videos. While it is encoded as 1080p, apparently due to compression artifacts or whatnot, there is a notable loss of detail that makes the result look like a good 480p shoot.And the audio for video, while fairly good, is also inferior to the 2014 Apple model. This is quite apparent when shooting at a concert.And, the S8 chews through battery rapidly, even with almost all app push notifications and auto updates turned off, and even with the phone in the middle battery saving mode with the processor and display throttled back. I couldn\'t get through a day in an amusement park without running out of battery.Lastly, while the OLED screen has stunning brightness and color gamut, the color accuracy is notably off. I found this to be occasionally irritating when watching movies, and it prevented me from accurately adjusting photos with photo editing apps.The phone is quite nice looking, and the iris scanner works better than I expected. The front facing camera the best I\'ve yet seen.

It appears much smaller in person than I expected when I ordered it.That I may be able to adapt to. It\'s the curved edges that are horrible. Not only do they make it appear even more narrow, but things on the edge are slightly distorted and the color is off unless you look at it dead on, and even then I can see a bit of distortion and discoloration on the curved edges. At an angle it\'s unbearable the way the edges are darker than the rest of the screen. It\'s especially noticeable when the screen is a solid light color, with the edges having a blue tint.This alone is a deal breaker for me. It\'s hard to look at.

It's hard to say where to place it because it feels natural where they put it. Maybe move camera, Regardless your camera lens Will be smudged.3rd bixby not interested in it and I don't have a choice. The dedicated button is in the worst spot.  If I hold phone in landscape to take pic, watch video, or what ever I hit the button (by the way I'm left handed) with thumb. Phone is so slick holding in landscape position is precarious already. Samsung and bloatware, bixby is to much and to dedicate an annoying button to it is absolutely dumb.4th the screen is curved on edges and can be touched or tapped. I have big hands, phone is slick, phone is thin, and edges are round so i try to grip it good especially in landscape. Watching a YouTube video as an example either I hit bixby button or  accidently hit top left corner  of screen dropping notifications bar down or in YouTube back video up 10 seconds(how i am double tapping is beyond me). I have ordered a case it's been a week waiting on shipping I hope this fixes most of these problems. Being one of the more expensive phones out there, You would think these things would be thought through.5th I liked having removable battery option but LG doesn't offer any more. So I am assuming no decent smart phone has that option anymore. But on average I get a new phone every 2-3 years and generally battery would be replaced once in that time. 600$-700$ it should last that long. Seems to be a rant but for the money it should be better. And for god sakes stop with the bloatware, and a dedicated physical button.

If the phone locks up you have to hope holding down the down and power buttons will interrupt the phone and force a reset.

The button is in an awkward location and when you hold the phone horizontally it causes Bixby to turn on unless you stretch your hand/fingers into awkward locations.3) Curved glass.  While this looks sleek and "sexy" it is kinda annoying.  If somebody is standing anywhere near you they can see what is going on on your phone.
